# Audio-to-Text Benchmarking

Add and remove authoritative-source-of-truth transcripts (baselines) in the `samples/truth/` directory, and ensure the audio files of the same name goes into `samples/audio/`. Use the `samples/**/hide/` directories to hide audio and text files from the script during a run.

Press the "Run All" button in the Jupyter Notebook to do a full run of the transcription and accuracy analysis process.
